<p>You smell Minh Khai before you can see it. Just thirty kilometers south of Hanoi, Vietnam, the
landscape shifts from urban bustle to an agrarian-industrial hybrid. Rice paddies give way to factories
towering over the narrow streets, and the scent of burning plastic and exhaust seeps through even closed
car windows. A faded red banner declares that you have arrived in “Ward Minh Khai.” What it doesn’t tell
you: You’ve entered the plastics recycling capital of Vietnam.</p>

<p>Today in Minh Khai, you can find every type of plastic imaginable – so long as it’s flimsy. Berms of multi-
colored plastic scrap, ranging in texture from single-use grocery bags to woven nylon tarps, line the streets
and loom over pedestrians. At first glance, the entire town resembles a landfill. On closer examination,
there’s structure to the apparent chaos. Each pile of waste is governed by a unique set of rules, sorted
according to its color, texture, or melting point; the flame it creates when burned; whether it sinks or
floats in water.</p>

<p>In the shadow of one of these piles, Phuong Nguyen is sifting through a fresh bundle of plastic. Her floral-
patterned head scarf bobs rhythmically as she evaluates the material in front of her. One clear plastic
sheet for the “good” pile, two clotting brown strips for the “bad.” Behind her, a young man wearing
coveralls and a t-shirt, feeds handfuls of plastic from the “good” pile into a machine that resembles,
somewhat eerily, the wood-chipper from Fargo.</p>

<p>From there, the mutilated plastic runs through a channel of steaming water into a sieve where it is fed,
once again by hand, into a melting furnace. The furnace is fitted with a machine that might best be
compared to a pasta-maker, which produces spaghetti-like strands of plastic on their way to be cut up into
orzo-sized chunks – a process the workers have dubbed “pelletizing.”</p>

<p>From her position at the start of the production line, Phuong points toward a pile of cast-aside scraps. All
these have to be thrown away, she says. They’re unusable, junk mixed in with the raw recyclables. And,
sometimes, they’re hazardous. It’s not unusual for Phuong to handle plastics coated with chemicals – like
battery acid – that irritate her skin. She’s started wearing gloves and long-sleeve shirts for that reason.
“You should try to clean up the plastic so it’s not polluted. Don’t just export all of it to Vietnam,” she says,
jabbing a pair of cutting shears into the air for punctuation.</p>

<p>The “you” might be translated here as “Americans.” Or, more generally, as “the West.” But what Phuong
means unequivocally is: anyone sending their undesirable plastic waste to her.</p>

      <article>
<p>Most of us don’t think much about recycling. We rinse our yogurt containers, crush our milk cartons,
and break down our boxes. We pause in front of public waste bins, puzzling over how to classify our
single-use forks or coffee cups. But once our trash hits the curb in a blue or a brown or a green bin, the
process becomes abstract. Our waste just goes where it’s meant to go.</p>

<p>When it comes to plastic, that destination might be farther from home than you imagine. With an
estimated life span over 450 years, every piece of plastic manufactured on Earth still exists today in some
form. If it isn’t buried in a landfill or floating in the ocean, your discarded plastic is likely circulating the
globe through a system of trade that transforms it from product, to waste, to commodity, and back to
product again.</p>

<p>There’s a hierarchy to the recycling world, too. Not all plastic is created equal. Items are labeled according
to chemical makeup, with numbers representing different recipes of plastic which involve ingredients with
names like polyvinyl chloride and acrylonitrile butadiene. Some ingredients are easier to recycle, and to
pronounce, than others.</p>

<p>Plastic bottles are among the most resilient recyclables. They’re labeled Grade 1. The thinnest and least
valuable plastics, low-density polyethylenes, are used in cling-wrap and grocery bags. These plastics are
labeled Grade 4. They’re cheap to produce and hard to reuse. From a recycler’s perspective, they’re fragile,
time-consuming to clean, and degrade rapidly – making it harder to turn a profit.</p>

<p>These are the plastics that feed Minh Khai.</p>

<p>In 2008, roughly 300 individual households in Minh Khai participated in the plastics recycling trade,
producing about 5,000 tons of plastic product each year. If you placed all of that plastic on a scale, it
would be enough to balance the weight of one thousand full-grown Asian elephants.</p>

<p>In the past decade, that volume has only increased. Plastic flows into Minh Khai from all over the globe.
In 2017, Vietnam processed TK percent of the world’s scrap plastic. In 2018, that number grew by tk.
California alone sent more than TK tons of plastic to Vietnam last year.</p>

<p>The global recycling trade has brought economic benefits to Minh Khai, but also substantial health and
environmental costs. The village was listed as one of Vietnam’s worst polluters by the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment. But for the people who live there, these costs are worth it; business owners
have built legacies from which to support their children and grandchildren. Trash-pickers who began
collecting waste 40 years ago now make salaries greater than the national average for Vietnam.</p>

<p>As the global market shifts, residents of Minh Khai wrestle with the blessings and curses of an empire
built on trash – even as they redefine their own place in the international recycling chain.</p>

<p>When it comes to change in Minh Khai, Tuan Dinh has had a front row seat. “This career has been a
tradition in my village,” he says. “I am the next generation.”</p>

<p>The forty-year-0ld has been in the recycling business for half his life. Like many young men, he used to
shred plastic as part of the “pelletizing” process. Recently, he’s taken on a new role. Tuan now runs a
transportation company that moves goods between businesses, ferrying material along the entire
recycling chain.</p>

<p>He leads a group of cargo drivers, whom he calls his “brothers.” Tuan’s wearing a bright red scarf, which
stands out against his green motorcycle jacket, as he surveys the street from his office – a three-walled
shed beside the entrance to Minh Khai. It’s been a slow day.</p>


        <div class="inline-asset">
         <img src="./assets/bg-2.jpg">
         <div class="caption">Photo caption here.... <span class="credit">Photo by Photographer</span></div>
        </div>

        <p>In front of him, a wooden shipping pallet burns slowly, helped along by candy wrappers and scraps of
        paper fed to it by the half-dozen young men waiting for their next assignment. They work on commision,
        relying on the steady demand throughout Minh Khai for laborers who can heft bundles of plastic into and
        out of vehicles.</p>

        <p>Tuan’s transportation business is an example of what makes Minh Khai unique. The village isn’t simply
        home to factories, but everything connected to the recycling process. When plastic enters the village, it
        arrives in raw bales. From there it might go to one business to be sorted, another to be cleaned and made
        into pellets, and yet another to be fashioned into fresh plastic bags.</p>

        <p>Entrepreneurs like Tuan have monetized every aspect of this cycle. He moves material from one stage of
        the process to the next. One of his neighbors sells containers that other businesses use to corral their
        pellets. A woman across town cooks and delivers the per diem meals that business owners provide to
        workers on the factory floor.</p>

        <p>“It’s almost like an ecology, because they fill in the gaps,” says Michael DiGregorio, a development analyst
        at the Asia Foundation in Hanoi.</p>

        <p>Michael became fascinated by Vietnam’s craft villages, including Minh Khai, in the 1990s. (The
        Vietnamese term is làng nghề, which translates more accurately to “occupational village”; it refers to
        communities that specialize in a single trade or industry.) The suburbs of Hanoi comprise dozens of these
        villages. Some are over one thousand years old, producing handicrafts like silk or ceramics.
        Others, like Minh Khai, have built names – in fact, entire capsule economies – using distinctly 20th-
        century means.</p>

      <article>

    <p>In the 1950s, Minh Khai was an agricultural community. Locals called it làng khoai – the potato village
    – for the root vegetable, khoai, that served as the region’s economic foundation. Once the Vietnam War
    began, however, the able-bodied young men of Minh Khai were called to fight. The potato village was left
    to its women.</p>

    <p>“Almost every craft village starts with some kind of clever person,” says DiGregorio. “The plastic recycling
    village, it really fits the mold.”</p>

    <p>In Minh Khai’s case, that clever person was a widow who – during the war – collected her neighbors’
    garbage. She filtered trash for salvageable items and sold them for a profit. What she couldn’t sell, she
    saved, and soon her home was filled with hoarded scrap. When the woman’s son returned from fighting in
    southern Vietnam, he took one look at his mother’s bottle caps and plastic bags and set off for the capital,
    determined to find a plastic manufacturer in Hanoi who would buy them. He did, and Minh Khai’s
    recycling industry began in earnest.</p>

    <p>The widow and her son quickly discovered what others in Asia had already learned – that oil prices in the
    1980s were at an all-time high, and plastic was cheaper to recycle than it was to create. Meanwhile,
    countries like the United States, which had grown increasingly dependent on plastic for packaging goods,
    had plenty of scrap they were happy to ship elsewhere.</p>

    <p>The pair soon enlisted friends to help with their growing business. Neighbors caught wind of the lucrative
    idea, and came up with their own complementary business plans. More and more people were drawn to
    the allure of plastic, and an entire chain of interdependent businesses developed in Minh Khai.
    “It was really out of necessity that people discovered this source of income,” says DiGregorio. “From
    necessity everything else developed.”</p>

    <p>In the transportation business, at least, necessity leads to commissions. Back at Tuan’s cargo hauling
    office, the wait is over. Two women wearing protective face masks and gloves appear beside his idle
    transporters. After a brief exchange, four of the young men spring into action. They pair off, speeding
    away on motorbikes – two per seat – to assist at the recently-offered job site.</p>       </article>

  <p>Across town, Le Thi Cam is unloading a fresh delivery of her own. She’s a boisterous woman, with a
  gravelly voice and a laugh that starts in her belly. Introducing herself as “Lady Orange” (a play on words
  that combines the phonetics of her surname with the English translation of cam, or “oranges”), she
  explains that she’s been in the recycling business for over 40 years.</p>

  <p>Cam started collecting plastic from neighboring provinces when she was 20 years old; she jokes that she
  became a business owner before she became a bride. Now she, her husband, and their four sons run a
  collection of businesses that incorporate every stage of the process – from gathering and melting to
  pelletizing and printing new products from recovered plastic.</p>

  <p>“Before, we literally didn’t have a place to live,” she says. “And now everyone has a big house, car, or
  motorcycle.”</p>

  <p>Indeed, between the piles of multicolored waste, the streets of Minh Khai reveal unexpected flashes of
  wealth. Sleek SUVs navigate the narrow alleys, flashing logos for Lexus, Mercedes, and Volkswagen. Near
  the town’s open-air market, an arcade houses a dozen flat screen monitors paired with the latest gaming
  consoles. Beside the archway that marks an entrance to Minh Khai, a new four-story home is under
  construction.</p>

  <p>“This business has saved a lot of people from poverty,” says Cam. She estimates that she and her husband
  make around 35 million dong (about $1500 U.S. dollars) in revenue per month – ten times the average
  salary in Hanoi.</p>

  <p>In Vietnam, she says, a person’s wealth does not belong to them. It belongs to their descendants. Outside
  of food and medical expenses, Cam’s money goes toward her childrens’ and grandchildrens’ futures. The
  sixty-seven year old owns thirty pieces of land, all purchased with her plastics fortune, and plans to pass
  these on to her kids.</p>

  <p>“I don’t have much to offer them,” she says. “A house, a piece of land will do.”</p>

  <p>But this land, like the rest of her children’s inheritance, comes with a catch. In order to run the business
  that has helped Cam’s family to flourish, they must remain within the polluted confines of Minh Khai.
  Four or five years ago, Cam says she and her husband lived in a spacious home outside the village. They
  worked in Minh Khai all day, and returned to the suburbs of Hanoi at night.</p>

  <p>Then, one night, a group of vandals snuck into her warehouse and burned it to the ground. Thirty tons of
  plastic, gone in a single evening.</p>

  <p>“I couldn’t save anything,” she says. “Just one flash of fire, then everything was done.”</p>

  <p>Cam and her husband moved back to Minh Khai and rebuilt their business. Now, they sleep above the
  machines that, by day, melt plastics from all around the world.</p>

  <p>Early last year, Vietnam found itself at the center of an international recycling “crisis.” Plastic waste is
  valuable, but it depends on how efficiently you can break down the scrap and reuse it. Things that can
  slow down that efficiency: environmental standards and safety codes like those enforced by the U.S.
  Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>For a long time, the cheapest thing to do with crummy plastic – like single-use grocery bags that were
  largely unprofitable in the U.S. – was to ship it overseas. Scrap material went to China, and other
  countries with comparatively relaxed environmental restrictions. In 2015, a study produced by the
  University of Georgia estimated that 78 percent of the countries receiving U.S. recyclables were
  mismanaging the waste. It was winding up in landfills, on the side of highways, in the oceans.</p>

  <p>The flood of junk to eastern Asia had gotten so bad, that in 2017 China announced plans to remove itself
  from the global recycling equation altogether. In early 2018, the country stopped accepting scrap
  recyclables, citing concerns about “dirty” and “potentially hazardous” material. Material that had to
  rapidly find a destination elsewhere.</p>

  <p>In the six months after China initiated its scrap ban – a policy dubbed “National Sword” or “Green Sword”
  by the Ministry of Environmental Protection – nearly half of all U.S. plastic exports shifted to Thailand,
  Malaysia and Vietnam. And as the flow of foreign plastic into Vietnam increased, the problems multiplied.</p>


  <section id="eighth">

  <article>
  <p>Not everyone in Minh Khai works with recyclables. But all are, in one way or another, impacted by the
  trade that has become ubiquitous.</p>

  <p>Nam Nguyen spends her afternoons weeding, watering, or harvesting a small garden plot near Minh Kai’s
  central, and only remaining, lake. (The area once had many lakes, but most were filled in to create more
  space for development.) She’s planted a small crop of banana trees and a fine, leafy green native to
  Vietnam. It’s a low-maintenance food source, Nam says. She simply throws down seeds and harvests them
  ten days later.</p>

  <p>The eighty-year-old is a thoughtful gardener; she carries water to her plants each day from a well fed by
  the Bach Mai canal. The aqueduct, which borders Minh Khai to the east, serves as an irrigation channel
  for the entire region.</p>

  <p>It’s also filthy. Grey sludge floats on the surface of the water. Discarded plastic and styrofoam mingle with
  soaps, sewage and household scraps. Greasy chickens pick at food concealed by half-submerged plastic
  bags. In July, Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment dispatched researchers to test
  the water in Minh Khai. The scientists collected samples from a dozen places along the canal; all twelve
  contained pollutants above the national standard.</p>

  <p>Each ton of plastic in Minh Khai requires between six and seven cubic meters of water to clean it – about
  the same volume of liquid inside a concrete mixer. Every truckload of water used in the cleaning process
  eventually makes its way back to the Bach Mai canal. It runs down streets, along gutters, and through
  pipes that empty into the aqueduct. During peak recycling season, the roads are so full of water from
  cleaning plastic that residents commute in rain boots.</p>

  <p>As a result, the drinking water in Minh Khai is what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
  euphemistically refers to as “high-strength” industrial run-off. A local newspaper, analyzing the ministry
  findings, reported that water in Minh Khai contains up to seven times more biological and chemical
  materials than standard for Vietnam – making it non-potable according to virtually every scale that exists.</p>

  <p>“People here usually use bottled water to cook and drink,” says Thao Nguyen. She grew up in Minh Khai
  and now runs a mobile pharmacy, serving as the village’s first source of health care. Thao’s aware of the
  dangers lurking in the canal, but says the use of bottled water can only limit, not completely prevent
  exposure to toxic materials.</p>

  <p>“When I wash vegetables, I still have to use well water,” she explains. “In the long term, it will affect our
  health.”</p>

  <p>In the fourteen years she’s worked as a pharmacist, Thao has noticed an increase in the number of
  recycling-related ailments. Cancer diagnoses are on the rise, she says, and the volume of small-scale
  injuries has risen with a growing industry and population. Her most requested medications are
  antibiotics, used to treat lung infections, and topical skin cream for rashes.</p>

  <p>But the dangers extend beyond those who transport or work directly with waste products. For the
  residents of Minh Khai, the problem is one of proximity; even if you protect yourself from the process, you
  cannot protect yourself from all of its byproducts. Workers wear masks to protect themselves from
  pollutants during the day, but not at night when they sleep. Toxins in the air, meanwhile, remain
  constant.</p>

  <p>“So many people suffer from allergies,” Thao says. “The smoke released when making the nylon and
  plastic is extremely polluted.”</p>

  <p>The air in Minh Khai, government officials have concluded, contains massive amounts of NH4+, also
  known as “atmospheric ammonia.” As a result of the recycling process, which requires the melting and
  burning of plastics, workers have been releasing NH4+ and other highly toxic chemicals – or dioxins –
  into the atmosphere for nearly half a century.</p>

  <p>Between the air and the water, residents of Minh Khai are living in a semi-permanent state of exposure to
  the world’s worst toxins. And the contamination doesn’t stop there; it’s also in their food. According to the
  World Health Organization, dioxins tend to accumulate in the food chain. Once they enter the body,
  they’re absorbed by fat tissue and stored. The higher an animal is on the food chain, the higher the
  concentration of dioxins. With a half-life of 7 to 11 years, it’s likely that every person in Minh Khai now
  carries the legacy of plastics recycling on a cellular level.</p>

  <p>Back in her garden, Nam harvests a fresh crop of greens from soil embedded with plastic chips. She
  jokingly describes her process as “organic.” The greens are tasty and fresh, she says: “No chemical use.”</p>

  <p>It’s true that Nam hasn’t sprayed pesticides on her crop. Just the same, toxins seep from her water into
  the vegetables, which go on to feed her family – as well as fish and chickens along the banks of the Bach
  Mai canal. Those chemicals build up in the meat, rice, and produce that fill plates all over town.</p>

<p>Tuan’s favorite meal is a simple one: Rice, soup, meat and fish. He prefers Minh Khai’s traditional fare
to the more elaborate, and expensive, specialties available in Hanoi. But it’s still hours before lunch time,
so Tuan contents himself with a cigarette break between deliveries.</p>

<p>“I am well aware that this job is toxic,” he says. He seems to think of the health hazards in Minh Khai as
necessary business expenses. In order to succeed in the short term, he says: “Obviously, I have to accept
the risk.”</p>

<p>This is a sentiment echoed by many in Minh Khai, and elsewhere in Vietnam. In recent years, laborers
have flocked from neighboring provinces to find work in the growing recycling village.</p>

<p>One machinist says he moved from Son La province, a 9-hour drive to the west, after leaving his job at a
Chinese-owned plastics factory. He’s grateful for this new position, because it allows for breaks – a
necessity after being diagnosed with first-stage lung cancer last year. When asked whether this diagnosis
makes him think differently about his current work, however, the machinist merely shakes his head. As
another laborer nearby puts it: “I will worry about the risks later. Now I have to work.”</p>

<p>When it comes to pollution, Michael DiGregorio says the root of Minh Khai’s problem is a regulation
issue. “On the one hand, these are remarkable places where you can see market coordination at the level
of the household,” he says. In a socialist republic like Vietnam, craft villages serve as potent reminders of
free market principles. Everything in Minh Khai is motivated by cost structure, he says.</p>

<p>“But when it comes to things outside of that, like ‘how do we manage pollution?’, which requires
coordination outside of a market mechanism, things go awry,” DiGregorio explains.</p>

<p>Take, for example, an initiative funded by the Vietnam-based Urban Environment Corporation
(URENCO) in the mid 1990s. The goal, DiGregorio says, was to implement air filtration devices in the
plastic-melting warehouses of Minh Khai. URENCO conducted outreach campaigns, encouraging
business owners to purchase ventilators for their buildings. The project was a failure, says DiGregorio.</p>

<p>No one in Minh Khai wanted the air filters. He cites this parable of the “free rider” to explain why:
“Let’s just say everybody is going to put temperature control heaters on their extruders, and ventilators on
the roofs, to limit the amount of pollution that’s caused through the melting of plastics. Say they do that.</p>

<p>Now everybody has to pay that extra amount of money for electricity, for equipment and other things. And
then somebody else in the village says ‘Screw that, I’m not going to do that.’ Right? Now he’s producing at
a lower cost.”</p>

<p>The “free rider,” in this case, has managed to avoid expenses his neighbors paid when they bought new
equipment – and costs they continue to incur to keep that equipment running. The neighbors may be
minimizing long-term health impacts for the community, but it’s hurting their bottom line. In a place like
Minh Khai, where the industry hinges on cheap production of low-value material, slight changes to a
business’ cost structure can be devastating. And there are few consequences for those who cut corners in
pursuit of profit.</p>

<p>“When somebody comes to the village to buy materials, they’re not buying a brand. They’re buying a
commodity,” he says. “So that person who cheats the system can just mix their product in with everybody
else’s.”</p>

<p>In other words, there’s no motivation for business owners to implement environmental improvements, if
it means that they can be underbid by less scrupulous neighbors. Without a strong regulating body to
enforce standards, individual businesses are even less incentivized to play by the rules.</p>

<p>This was a problem Vietnam faced on a global scale in 2018, according to Tuan Nguyen, who reports
on economics and trade for Tien Phong, one of Vietnam’s largest newspapers. Inundated with plastics in
the wake of China’s “National Sword” policy, government officials were at a loss.</p>

<p>“There were thousands of scrap containers backlogged in Vietnam’s ports,” says Nguyen. The Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environment was quickly ordered to “investigate, verify and solve the problem”
and “prevent Vietnam from becoming the world’s landfill.”</p>

<p>The ministry’s solution: a ban to mirror “National Sword.” In an attempt to stem the tide of displaced
(and still contaminated) plastics, Vietnam froze new imports arriving in Hai Phong port.</p>

<p>The ripple effects of that decision can still be felt in Minh Khai. On the street where Le Thi Cam and her
family continue to run their plastics businesses, others have been forced to close their shops. There simply
isn’t enough domestic plastic alone to sustain them.</p>

<p>One man and his wife, after only four months in business, were selling their equipment at a loss and
moving to a new province. They hope to start over, with a new trade: raising flowers. Short of leaving
Minh Khai, there are few alternatives for business owners who can’t make it in the recycling trade.</p>

<p>“Look, there is no more land to farm,” says Tuan Dinh. “If I don’t do this recycling job, I don’t know how
to make money.”</p>

<p>In some respects, the residents of Minh Khai have become captives of their own success. Michael
DiGregorio compares the dearth of international plastics today to the Asian Financial crisis of the 1990s.
At that time, threatened by a shrinking supply chain, recyclers in Minh Khai retreated back into their
agricultural specialty of farming khoai. But it’s unlikely that business owners in Minh Khai could do the
same today. Between the landscape alterations and chemical by-products, agriculture is no longer a viable
possibility for workers there.</p>

<p>For his part, Tuan supports the scrap ban. He hopes that, rather than starving the industry that feeds his
community, they policy (which he views as temporary) will encourage other countries to improve the
recycling process at home -- making his work healthier and more sustainable.</p>

<p>“I think we have to make it clear that if Europe and Africa, America and Asia cannot recycle their trash
and [instead] export it to Vietnam, we will become an international landfill,” he says.</p>

<p>David Biderman is the executive director of SWANA, the Solid Waste Association of North America. He
says that “National Sword” – and the subsequent bans in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, have certainly
had an impact across the Pacific.</p>

<p>“Recycling facilities have had to address the contamination issue,” he says. Recycling facilities in the
United States, overwhelmed by backed-up exports, have begun slowing down conveyor belts, hiring more
people, and buying new equipment.</p>

<p>“Recycling isn’t collapsing,” Biderman adds. “It’s adjusting to a national economic disruption. People are
seeing that if this material isn’t moving to China, it needs to be processed somewhere.”</p>

<p>But where, exactly, should our trash go? One solution is to improve the United State’s domestic
infrastructure (a process that still requires some work). What remains less clear is what will happen in
places like Minh Khai, which have embraced and evolved around a commodity that, for decades, no one
else wanted.</p>

<p>“All the recycling businesses are really, really dirty businesses,” acknowledges Michael DiGregorio. “And
it’s very easy, from a perspective of living in California, to look and say this is really terrible, oppressive,
dirty business.” But he adds: “People earn their living on it.”</p>

<p>Minh Khai’s future remains as murky as the water in its last and only lake. There were once dozens of
ponds and estuaries near the village, but most were filled in to satisfy a growing demand for factory real
estate. This opaque green pool is all that remains of the area’s once lush wetlands.</p>

<p>“Elders like me don’t have many things to do at home, so we usually come here to play,” says Huan Dinh,
sitting on a park bench near the water. After nearly 50 years in the recycling business, Huan’s now retired.
Behind him, a group of men – all former plastics workers – are loudly observing a chess match. They
comment and cheer openly, egging the competitors on as if it were a boxing match, not a game of strategy.</p>

<p>One of the other retirees, Hanh Nguyen, drifts toward the lake; he’s looking for fish. Hanh raises Tilapia
and a breed of ceremonial goldfish, which he admits are more for aesthetic than economic purposes.
“In the morning they will swim up [to the surface],” he says. “It’s stunning.”</p>

<p>Hanh became the unofficial fish caretaker of Minh Khai when age and health finally drove him from his
recycling business. Now, his kids manage the work. Asked whether he enjoys this second career, Hanh
grins: “Is there anyone who wouldn’t? Fish are the source of life.”</p>

<p>But introducing life to the village’s polluted waterways has not been an easy task. Hanh himself had to
clean the lake before seeding it, and even now the Tilapia are for “looks” not for eating. After all, they’re
cleaning the lake too – by digesting contaminants that float in its murky waters.</p>

<p>Retirement has given both Hanh and Huan time to reflect on what they hope for the future. In Hanh’s
case, that includes a lake filled with fish. For Huan, the desire for health and prosperity extends to
humans as well. His children, now grown, wanted to follow in his footsteps and enter the plastics trade.</p>

<p>“I told them this career was good for nothing,” Huan says. He encouraged his children and grandchildren
to pursue jobs in Hanoi, instead. Those jobs are adequate, he explains; his kids now make between 5 and
6 million dong a month (the equivalent of $260 in U.S. dollars). It’s a fraction of what they would make in
Minh Khai, but the work comes with fewer risks.</p>

<p>“They don’t have to collect trash,” he says. “That’s enough.”</p>
