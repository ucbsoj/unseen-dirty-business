## Instructions

The full template is here:

You don't have to copy-and-paste the text, because the text in this template
isn't the real or final draft. So placeholders are OK.

Most of the chapter headings will be video autoplaying loops. But Todd (the
student) is concerned not all will be ready in time, so some may need to fall
back as images. 

The top introduction will be a looping video, with a play button. When the
play button is pressed, a lightbox (popup) will display a short vimeo video
that will play an introduction. 

The titles of each chapter will be embedded in the image, so any code to keep
some hidden HTML (for SEO purposes) will be appreciated.
